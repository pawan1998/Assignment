## Features 

# Page to search for a particular phrase or keyword. Store the results locally

# Page reflecting a list of searches being made & its results. Open the original news article in a new tab.

# Add a button to refresh (fetch latest) search results.

# Sort search results based upon the “Date published”.

# A README.md file with steps to setup, exact time you took

# Proper documentation of each method/module using docstrings

# Prevent frequent searches for the same keyword, e.g., we should not make multiple requests to the News API within a set threshold (say 15 minutes) period.

# Add filters for Date published, Name and Category of source & Article language to the list of articles for a given keyword.

# Don’t create a new keyword search for pre-existing keywords in the user’s account. We’ll be looking forward to how you manage to optimise UX here.

## Time taken 

# 4 days; mostly done over the weekend due to exisiting time constraints.  

## Working 

# I believe a bit more details of the exercise would have proved to be very helpful for me.
# Pretty good learning experience and supportive management.

# What would you have done differently 

# Implement CBV, instead of of condtionally branching inside function. 
# I would have used the Python client library of making HTTP request explicitly.
# Learn and utilize DB caching, redis maybe, for job scheduling.
